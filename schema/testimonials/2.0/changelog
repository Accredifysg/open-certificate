## 2.0

- Schema is now based on the latest OpenCerts 2.1 structure, inlining all core definitions and properties for improved reliability and maintainability.
- The schema is fully self-contained and no longer uses allOf or external $ref to OpenAttestation schemas.
- Updated issuer structure to follow OpenCerts 2.1, supporting modern identityProof mechanisms (DNS-TXT, DID, DNS-DID, etc.) and allowing additional properties.
- Removed the `schema` property from the root object.
- Updated required fields to include `issuers` and removed `schema`.
- Inherits all OpenCerts 2.1 properties (e.g., `$template`, `qualificationLevel`, `fieldOfStudy`, `skills`, etc.) for maximum compatibility.
- Retained and validated custom `testimonial` and `referee` objects.
- Updated all example documents to match the new schema and demonstrate advanced issuer configurations and identity proof mechanisms.
