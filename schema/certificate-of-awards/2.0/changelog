## 2.0

- Schema is now based on the latest OpenCerts 2.1 structure, inlining all core definitions and properties for improved reliability and maintainability.
- The schema is fully self-contained and no longer uses allOf or external $ref to OpenAttestation schemas.
- Added custom properties: `award` (with instituteName, achievementArea, achievementYear, achievementDate) and `signature` (with name, designation, signature, seal) to support certificate of awards use cases.
- Updated required fields to include `award` and `signature` in addition to the standard OpenCerts 2.1 fields.
- All other properties and validation rules are inherited from OpenCerts 2.1 for maximum compatibility.

### Example JSON Updates in 2.0

- Removed the `"schema"` property from the example document.
- Updated the `issuers` array to support multiple issuers, with new example issuers ("Blockchain Academy", "School of Crypto-economics").
- Removed the `uen` field from issuers and added support for additional/optional issuer properties.
- Updated `identityProof.location` to use a generic example domain.
- Added a `$template` property to support custom renderer configuration.

### New Example Files in 2.0

- Added `example-did-document.json` to demonstrate a certificate with a DID-based issuer, including DID identity proof and revocation structure.
- Added `example-dns-did-document.json` to demonstrate a certificate with a DNS-DID-based issuer, showing DNS-DID identity proof and location usage.

### Test Updates in 2.0

- Added comprehensive tests for the custom `award` and `signature` properties:
  - Ensured the schema fails validation when both `achievementYear` and `achievementDate` are missing in `award`.
  - Ensured the schema fails when `achievementDate` is not a valid date.
  - Ensured the schema fails when `achievementYear` is not a valid year (pattern mismatch).
  - Ensured the schema fails when `signature.name` is missing.
- Updated the test suite to follow the modern OpenCerts 2.1 style and validation approach, using open-attestation's `issueDocument`, `addSchema`, and `validateSchema`.
- Removed legacy v1.0 tests and obsolete property checks to focus on the new schema structure and requirements.
